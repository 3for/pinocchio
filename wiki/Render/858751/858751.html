<div class="wikidoc">It&#39;s possible (in recent versions of Pinocchio) to indicate that some of the prover&#39;s inputs should be &quot;hidden&quot; from the verifier. <br /><br />1. Your program needs to take a third NIZK struct (in addition to the usual input/output structs). The compiler will turn those into prover-only values. This results in an arithmetic circuit file where some of the input wires are labeled &quot;nizkinput&quot; rather than just &quot;input&quot;. <br /><br />2. You need to use the -nizk flag on the qapv2.exe commandline.<br /><br />There is an example called &quot;nizk-test.c&quot; demonstrating how to do this in code.</div><div class="ClearBoth"></div>
